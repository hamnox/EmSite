"Proper?" asked the Comet King. "I come to you with a plan to fight off Hell and save the world, and you tell me it isn't *proper*?"

Vihaan stared at the priest, as if begging him to step in. "I swear," said Father Ellis, "it's like explaining the nature of virtue to a rock".

"Do you know," interrupted Jalaketu, "that whenever it's quiet, and I listen hard, I can hear them? The screams of everybody suffering. In Hell, around the world, anywhere. I think it is a power of the angels which I inherited from my father." He spoke calmly, without emotion. "I think I can hear them right now."

Ellis' eyes opened wide. "Really?" he asked. "I'm sorry. I didn't..."

"No," said the Comet King. "Not really."

They looked at him, confused.

"No, I do not really hear the screams of everyone suffering in Hell. But I thought to myself, 'I suppose if I tell them now that I have the magic power to hear the screams of the suffering in Hell, then they will go quiet, and become sympathetic, and act as if that changes something.' Even though it changes nothing. Who cares if you can hear the screams, as long as you know that they are there? So maybe what I said was not fully wrong. Maybe it *is* a magic power granted only to the Comet King. Not the power to hear the screams. But the power not to have to."

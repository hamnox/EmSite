Out of Darkness into light 
We have traveled through the darkness,
   Thou and I, for many days;
Till we wondered at the sunshine,
   When at length we felt its rays.

Chill and lonely was the pathway,
   Only lighted by the snow,
With the cutting east wind only
   To declare how we should go.

On our right, the frozen river,
   Where the drowned lay asleep; 
On our left, the rocky mountain, 
   So precipitously steep;

All around the gloomy shadows
   Of the failures gone before; 
While the leafless branches whispered, 
   We should do no less, no more.

We should falter and should stumble,
   And should fail to reach the end; 
And should die in the beginning— 
   Die together, O my friend!

Die together?—'twas a jewel
   Which they threw us, for a stone: 
Come what might, we could remember 
   That we should not be alone;

So, with hands entwined the closer, 
   We pressed on against the blast; 
And we bided for the daylight, 
   And the daylight came at last.

First, the darkness grew to blackness,
   And we shivered in the cold;
And we trembled, lest our fingers
   Should not keep their faithful hold;

Then a strange grey veil fell on us,—
   Was it darkness? was it light? 
And we questioned each, "What is it? 
   Coming day, or coming night?"

Then upon the far horizon
   Came the faintest tint of gold; 
Then the cloud became a glory, 
   And the mystery was told;

Richer, deeper, grew the radiance, 
   Till our eyes could hold no more. 
We had traveled to the eastward, 
   And our journeying was o'er.

Now the light is round about us, 
   And the sun to guide our feet; 
And along the mountain pathway 
   Shine the flowers, pale and sweet;

And we pluck us each a blossom
   To remind us as we go, 
How we went, we two together, 
   Through the darkness and the snow;

And, whate'er may be the friendships
   We may gain in after years,
None can come between the compact
   Which has been annealed by tears.
